For Loop/While Loop
question please ,,. can we get the result as in a column list?
the out come instead of horizental, we get it vertical, make sense?


i asked ,,, so i have to print each element by itself? what if I have big data, say 1000 row?


For loop
{
'Geovanny',
'Prakas',
'Rabie',
'Rute',
'Niveethaa'
}

1 -> a = [] - List/Set/Tuple
2 -> a = {} - List/Set/Tuple
3 -> a = () - List/Set/Tuple
