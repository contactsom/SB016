Line1 Tools like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and specialized charting libraries (like Chart.js, ApexCharts) can interpret and display data in this format as line charts.

Line2 Line charts can display continuous data over time, set against a common scale, and are therefore ideal for showing trends in data at equal intervals or over time.

Line3 As a general rule, use a line chart if your data has non-numeric x values â€” for numeric x values, it is usually better to use a scatter chart.

Line4 If you want to plot temperature over time, the first column could be "Date" (x-axis), and the second column could be "Temperature" (y-axis).

Line5 If you want to compare two different datasets, you could have columns for "Date", "Dataset 1 Values", and "Dataset 2 Values".
